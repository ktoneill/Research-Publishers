    <p >
        Book proposals should answer the following questions:</p>
    <p >
        1. Title and subject. What is the proposed title for the book? What are some
        possible alternative titles? What is the subject matter and content domain? What
        is the book&#39;s premise, theme, or purpose?</p>
    <p>
        2. Author background and experience. What special experience do you bring to the
        project? Is the book based upon prior research and writings? What training and
        experience do you have as a writer? Provide examples of prior publications.
        Attach your resume.</p>
            <p>3. Potential markets. What are the potential markets for the book (trade paperback, mass-market paperback, hardcover)? Will it be used as a textbook or reference book? If it is a textbook, give titles of courses in which it could be used. At what level (high school, undergraduate, graduate) are these courses taught? If it is a reference book, which professional groups or associations would be most interested in the book?</p>
<p>4. Competition. For the subject matter of your proposed book, what are the competitive books? What is the best book currently available in this area? Why will your book be better? What problems does your book solve? What makes your book unique? If it is a textbook, why would an instructor select your book over others? If it is a reference book, why would a professional select your book over others?</p>

<p>5. Organization and length. How is your book organized? Show the proposed table of contents. How many pages will be needed for each topic?</p>
<p>6. Production. Describe your current work environment. To what extent do you utilize proofreaders, copyeditors, and developmental editors? What computer hardware and software systems are you using to write your book?</p>

<p>7. Schedule and sample chapters. What is the status of your book? Is it an idea or a reality? How much of the book has been written? Provide materials that you have written so far, such as the book preface and sample chapters. What is your proposed schedule for writing the book? When will it be finished?</p>
            <p>An author's book proposal should be formatted as an Adobe Acrobat pdf file or ASCII text file. Files with executable content, such as Microsoft Word files, will not be accepted.</p>

            <h4>Writing <small>Advice</small></h4>
            <p>We are great believers in clear and simple writing. Short words are better than long words. Short sentences are better than long sentences. And short paragraphs are better than long paragraphs.</p><p>

Clear writing follows from clear thinking. Slow down and take a break. Know what you want to say before you start writing.</p><p>

Professional authors do not turn in first drafts. They write, then rewrite. Edit. Eliminate unnecessary words. Rewrite again. Spell-check all manuscripts. Before they submit manuscripts, they have others proofread what they have written.</p>

            <p>There are many good sources of advice for writers. Our favorite book is Zinsser's (1985) On Writing Well, which is also available on audio tape (Zinsser 1991). The Elements of Style by Strunk and White (2000) is a classic that should be on everyone's bookshelf. Additional sources of advice cited below include books by Lederer and Dowis (1995) and Williams (2000).</p><p>

Throw out your thesaurus, and get a copy of The Synonym Finder by J. I. Rodale (Urdang and LaRoche 1978). This is truly the writer's best friend. Writers in the know simply talk about "reaching for their Rodale."</p><p>

RP's reference for formal writing and the preparation of manuscripts for publication is The Chicago Manual of Style (University of Chicago Press 2003). For spelling, we refer to Merriam-Webster's Collegiate Dictionary (Merriam-Webster 2003).</p><p>

Lederer and Dowis (1999, p. 62) note that the ten most common word confusions are, in order of frequency, lie/lay, fewer/less, different from/different than, amount/number, compose/comprise, farther/further, disinterested/uninterested, affect/effect, imply/infer, and among/between. They show how these words are properly used. For those who prefer a dictionary approach, Merriam-Webster's Concise Dictionary of English Usage (2002) may be found at many bookstores.</p>

            <p>Research Publishers LLC develops quality publications for business and research professionals. </p>
              <p>
To ensure the highest quality in our books, we provide editing with knowledge of the markets we serve, as well as extensive copyediting services.</p>

              <h4>Typesetting <small>Automatic, Electronic</small></h4>
            <p>Research Publishers LLC develops quality publications for business and research professionals. </p><p>
We use a proprietary typesetting system built upon LaTeX and Adobe graphics software. Book covers are professionally designed and display creative artwork. Books are printed at high resolution on bright white sixty-pound paper. The result is books that look and feel good.</p><p>

Support for our electronic typesetting efforts is provide by Amy Hendrickson of TeXnology, Inc., Boston.

              <h4>Cover and Artwork <small>Support of the Arts</small></h4>
            <p>Research Publishers LLC publishes books with professionally designed covers. The covers of Research and Information Services, Getting Started with Conjoint Analysis, and Qualitative Research Online were designed by Jane Tenenbaum, an artist and graphic designer who owns and operates Tenenbaum Design in Madison, Wisconsin. Jane's skills range across the design process, reaching a variety of audiences through books and other publishing formats. In addition to RP, her long-term clients include University of Wisconsin, University of California Press, and Impressions Book and Journal Services.</p><p>

RP supports the arts by developing close relationships with artists and distributing quality artwork on its book covers. Book cover artwork comes from three primary sources: (1) masterworks, (2) royalty-free art and photo stock, and (3) creative works by independent artists. Cover artwork is selected to be consistent with the content of our books.</p>

          <p>We reproduce masterworks with licenses and royalties managed by representatives of artists and their estates. The cover of <a href="gscaaboutcover.html"><em>Getting Started with Conjoint Analysis</em></a> uses artwork by Paul Klee (1879-1940) with a license to reproduce granted by the Paul Klee estate. The book deals with methodologies for consumer and business research and the choices that buyers make with a utility maximization motive. The artwork on the book's cover reflects its content: Imagine the face of a bewildered consumer, enough feet to go in many directions at once, and an arrow pointing upward out of his head (a possible symbol for utility maximization).The cover for <a href="qroaboutcover.html"><em>Qualitative Research Online</em></a> utilizes royalty-free art and photo stock. The artwork may be thought of as showing the eye of a consumer respondent in an online medium, which is in keeping with the topic of the book.
          </p>
          <p>For <a href="raisaboutcover.html"><em>Research and Information Services</em></a>, the cover art by James Wrinkle (Bi-Ab Series #15, 2000) is an example of biomorphic abstract art, a modern type of abstract art in which the shapes and masses are abstracted from the living and animate rather than geometric and inanimate objects. James Wrinkle is an independent artist who lives in California. Learn more about the artist at <a href="http://www.jameswrinkle.com/">http://www.jameswrinkle.com</a>.</p>
          <p>Our relationships with independent artists include cooperative publishing agreements designed to promote the artists as well as our books. In direct mail promotions for <em>Research and Information Services</em>, we wrote: "What is it? Two brain cells rendered as biomorphic abstract art... Imagine what would be possible if research and information professionals danced together the way these neurons do. The book shows how."</p>
